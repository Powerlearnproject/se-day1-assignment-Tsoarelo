-Web development, with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabled the creation of dynamic and interactive online experiences.
-Cloud computing further revolutionized software deployment and delivery, providing on-demand -access to computing resources.
This milestone created the world of interconnected software, that we use today.
These milestones represent significant advancements in software engineering, each building upon the previous one to address the evolving challenges of software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
*The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development, comprising a series of stages that help ensure the development of high-quality software. Here is a list of the main stages in the SDLC, along with explanations:

Requirement Gathering and Analysis:

Objective: Understand and define the software requirements.
Activities: The development team works with stakeholders, including clients and end-users, to gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements. This phase may involve interviews, surveys, and analysis of current systems.
Outcome: A clear understanding of the needs and objectives of the project, documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
System Design:

Objective: Create an architecture and design for the software system based on the gathered requirements.
Activities: Designers create high-level system architecture, define technical specifications, and determine the software and hardware requirements. This may involve designing data models, user interfaces, and algorithms.
Outcome: System design documents and prototypes, including both high-level design (HLD) and detailed design (low-level design or LLD).
Implementation (Coding):

Objective: Convert design into a working software product.
Activities: Developers write the code for the software using appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and tools. This stage is focused on turning the design into an executable program.
Outcome: The actual software codebase.
Testing:

Objective: Ensure the software works as expected and meets the specified requirements.
Activities: The software undergoes various tests such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. The goal is to identify and fix bugs, validate functionality, performance, and security, and ensure that the software behaves correctly under different scenarios.
Outcome: A stable, functional software product with any defects identified and corrected.
Deployment:

Objective: Release the software to the users or customers.
Activities: The software is deployed in the production environment. This can involve installation on user systems, cloud deployment, or launching a website. Sometimes this phase includes a beta testing release.
Outcome: The software is now operational and available for end-users.
Maintenance:

Objective: Ensure the software continues to function well and adapt to changes over time.
Activities: After deployment, the software enters a phase of regular maintenance. This may include fixing bugs reported by users, releasing patches for vulnerabilities, and updating the software to address new requirements or improve performance.
Outcome: A well-maintained and updated software product that continues to meet the needs of its users.
Iterative Models:

Many SDLC processes, such as Agile or Scrum, focus on iterative cycles, meaning these phases are revisited multiple times throughout the development. Each iteration focuses on developing a working subset of the software, with regular updates and refinements.
The stages are flexible, and organizations can tailor them based on the project’s needs and complexity.
